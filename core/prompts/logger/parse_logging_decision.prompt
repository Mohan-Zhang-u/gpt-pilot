Now, parse the previous explanation about whether to add more logs or if the explanation is clear. If logs need to be added, write 5 lines of code before the line where the log needs to be added. Each log needs to start with "PYTHAGORA_DEBUGGING_LOG". Here is an example:
Let's say we have a Python code snippet like this:
```
    async def run(self) -> bool:
        """
        Run the Orchestrator agent.

        :return: True if the Orchestrator exited successfully, False otherwise.
        """
        response = None

        print(f"Starting {__name__}.Orchestrator")

        self.executor = Executor(self.state_manager, self.ui)
        self.process_manager = self.executor.process_manager
        # self.chat = Chat() TODO

        await self.init_ui()
        await self.offline_changes_check()

        # TODO: consider refactoring this into two loop; the outer with one iteration per comitted step,
        # and the inner which runs the agents for the current step until they're done. This would simplify
        # handle_done() and let us do other per-step processing (eg. describing files) in between agent runs.
        while True:
            await self.update_stats()

            agent = self.create_agent(response)
            response = await agent.run()

            if response.type == ResponseType.EXIT:
                break

            if response.type == ResponseType.DONE:
                response = await self.handle_done(agent, response)
                continue
```

and the new log that needs to be added is `print(f"Starting {__name__}.Orchestrator")`, you should provide this as a reference code snippet:
```

        :return: True if the Orchestrator exited successfully, False otherwise.
        """
        response = None

```
and `print(f"PYTHAGORA_DEBUGGING_LOG: Starting {__name__}.Orchestrator")` as a log.

**IMPORTANT**
Make sure that you outline **ALL** logs that need to be added and not miss any.

**IMPORTANT**
Make sure that `referenceCodeSnippet` contains **ONLY** the code that is currently written in the file. It must not contain the log that you want to add.
